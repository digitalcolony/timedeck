# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The World Clock Dashboard is a single-page web application that allows users to track current time across multiple major cities worldwide. Users can select cities to display, view real-time clock information, and manage their city selections with persistent storage. This creates a personalized dashboard for users who need to coordinate across different time zones.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select major cities from around the world, so that I can track time in locations that are relevant to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a city selection interface
2. WHEN the user searches or browses cities THEN the system SHALL provide a list of major cities from different continents
3. WHEN the user selects a city THEN the system SHALL add that city to their dashboard
4. WHEN the user selects a city that is already on their dashboard THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate entries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the current time for each selected city, so that I can quickly understand what time it is in different locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a city is displayed on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show the current local time for that city
2. WHEN time passes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the displayed time in real-time
3. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL show both the time and date in a clear, readable format
4. WHEN displaying time THEN the system SHALL indicate the time zone for each city

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to remove cities from my dashboard, so that I can keep only the locations that are currently relevant to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a city is displayed on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a remove/delete option for that city
2. WHEN the user clicks the remove option THEN the system SHALL immediately remove the city from the dashboard
3. WHEN a city is removed THEN the system SHALL update the persistent storage to reflect the change

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my selected cities to be remembered when I return to the application, so that I don't have to re-select my cities every time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects or removes cities THEN the system SHALL store the current city list in local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL load their previously selected cities from local storage
3. WHEN no previous selections exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty dashboard with instructions to add cities
4. WHEN local storage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL still function but without persistence

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and intuitive interface, so that the application is pleasant and easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern user interface
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL organize city clocks in a visually appealing layout
3. WHEN using the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design
4. WHEN interacting with controls THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for user actions
